This program was created by Ivan Zavyalov a.k.a. CreeperDude372 online.

Start the program by typing "./login" in terminal once inside the folder.

NOTE: This is made ONLY for Ubuntu, compiled under Ubuntu 18.04.1 using gcc.

There are custom icons but idk if they are going to come in with the folder if I upload this onto Github. If they do come in, "sys" is a folder.

Type "man ./sysman" in terminal for a description.
